For this hands-on assessment, you will create a student class from which you will instantiate objects.

Create a class named Student that can hold the following data about a student:

    Name
    Student ID number
    GPA
    Expected grade in this course
    Full time or part time
    Create five student objects from this class. One of these objects must be you!

Write class methods that will handle the following functions:

    Look up and print the GPA of a single student
    Add a new student to the class
    Print the data of all the students in a tabular format
    Quit the program
    Save all the files that you create in this program with appropriate file names - lastname_firstname_module5.py



# def main():
#     # Create a simple text file in which you will store the numbers 0 through 10, each on a separate line.
#     # Now write a program that does the following:
#     numbers = []
#     i = 0
#     while i < 11:
#         # Strip the list of the end of line markers or the "\n"
#         numbers.append(str(i))
#         i += 1
#     print(numbers)
#     outfile = open('christopherOsborneNumbers.txt', 'w')
#     for num in numbers:
#         numbers = num + '\n'
#         # theNum = 0
#         # while theNum < len(numbers):
#         #     numbers = str(numbers[theNum]) + '\n'
#         print(numbers)
#         outfile.write(numbers)
#     outfile.close()
#     # print(numbers)
#
# main()
